## The Importance of Documenting

We cannot stress how important it is to document your event, and we hope you join us in creating this guidebook, or become inspired to create your own.

## Pre-Event Documentation

If you've got crew, volunteers, or helpers for your event, providing them with documentation beforehand can be quite helpful. 


## Post-Event Documentation

Documentation after your event can be valuable not only for you and your crew, but for others as well.

### For The Future

When you document your event you take part in writing an operations manual not just for your future self, but for you team. You may find with annual events that the crew changes, and people who have been instrumental in specfic areas for years may not be able to continue on forever, and rather than lose their institutional knowledge it's a good idea to capture it in some form. 

You might ask a volunteer coordinator or area captain what the essential things are needed to know to fulfill that role. They may have spent years in a specific role and while it has become simple and second nature to them, someone else stepping into the rol may be lost, and a quick write-up about how to do things can be very valuable.


### For Marketing

Documenting things like attendance numbers and tickets sold can be useful information for sponsors, and photos & video of your event will help tell the story of your event. The images and experiences you share can go a long way to explaning what your even is, and what people who have never been to it can expect. If you can share with sponsors images showing a well attended event with smiling attendees this can help show the value of their sponsorship.



## Help Wanted

We will be on-boarding contributors for the overall event topics, and then will turn our attention to using this playbook as a template that can be forked and used for your event.

If you are an Open Source wizard that is great with GitHub, we can use your help to get this process working! Find us in the Nation of Makers Slack #maker_event_playbook channel, or ping one of the [project collaborators](collaborators.html).
