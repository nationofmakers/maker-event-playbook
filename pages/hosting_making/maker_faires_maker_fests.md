Maker Faires & Maker Fests tend to be large-scale events, often multiple days, and may host dozens or even hundreds of makers. Sometimes these events are free, and sometimes tickets must be purchased by attendees.

## What is the difference between a Maker Faire and a Maker Fest?

To organize a Maker Faire, you must have a [signed licensing agreement](https://makerfaire.com/global/guidelines/) with [Make:](https://make.co/). There is no license required for a _Maker Fest_, as Maker Fest is a generic term that some event organizers use if they are unable to license the name Maker Faire, or choose not use the name Maker Faire. (If you ask a Maker Fest organizer what their event is like, they'll often say "It's like a Maker Faire!")
