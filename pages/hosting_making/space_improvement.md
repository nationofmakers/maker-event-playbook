Space Improvement is a specific type of maker event that is focused on improving or cleaning a makerspace. This might be in the form of a monthly or weekly cleanup or dsy to focus on larger projects to improve a space. Some makerspaces "close" during their cleanup/improvment event and do not allow making, and instead require anyone at the space to pitch in and help make the space better.
