## Make-A-Thon

A Make-A-Thon is an event that focuses on making things. Sometimes this will take the form of a timed event, often with teams, that are given a challenge to create something. These may be events focused on fun, or on solving specific problems.

Another form of Make-A-Thon may be an open-house style event where people have the opportunity to visit multiple hands-on stations and make things that they can take home. These are great outreach events that introduce the general public to making things.

Some makerspaces do a "Holiday Make-A-Thon" which allows people to make holiday-themed items such as ornaments, gift tags, wrapping paper, or even small gifts. People get to learn a new skill and leave with something that they made. 

## Hackathon

Hackathons are often (but not always) software based events, where individuals or teams work towards creating something in a short amount of time. Often hackathons run overnight and teams present their work at the end of the event. Hackathons may have judges and prizes for the top projects.

## Game Jam

A Game Jam is similar in structure to a Hackathon, but focuses on creating games. It compresses the process of designing and creating a game into a tight deadline.
