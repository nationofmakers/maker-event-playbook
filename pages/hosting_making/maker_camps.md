## In-Person Maker Camps

Maker Camps are almost always kid or youth oriented events, like a day camp or summer camp. that are focused on making. These may be run at a makerspace or a science center or even a children's museum. They tend to cover hands-on making but often include digital design and making as well.

## Virtual Maker Camps

Maker Camps are sometimes virtual, and might use projects that can be done with materials common around the house, or require kits/materials to be delivered to campers.
