Artists are Makers! If you are part of a makerspace or maker group, or even organize a maker event, you've probably seen some amazing art, and maybe some of that art deserves to be in a gallery!

A "Maker Takeover" is basically a maker group doing a gallery show and displaying art that may not normally be included in a typical art gallery. These are great opportunities to cross-pollinate people between the art world and the maker world (as well as a great way to promote your maker group or maker event!)
