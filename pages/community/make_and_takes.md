## What is a "Make and Take"?

First of all, a Make and Take is a lot of fun! A "Make and Take" typically involves facilitating a hands-on workshop where participants get to _make_ something and _take_ it home with them. Pretty simple, right?

In the [Makers Hosting a Making Event]({{site.baseurl}}/hosting_making) section we covered a lof of the basics of a [Make and Takes]({{site.baseurl}}/hosting_making/make_and_takes) so here we'll cover what you'll need to know when you're taking your Make and Take to another location.

## Hit the Road

When you're doing your Make and Take at another location, not your own makerspace, library, workshop, etc. you'll need to plan ahead to make sure you've got what you need. Do you need electricity? Extension cords? Power strips? Access to water? These are all things you'll need to discuss with the host of the event (which is someone else this time!)

Some other things to consider: Will the event be outside? Do you need a tent? Will you have to battle wind, rain, heat and other elements?
