If you've ever got together with a group of makers but didn't neceesarily _make_ anything, perhaps you were at a **Maker Social** event. These may be networking events, or maker dinners, or just getting together with friends (who happen to be makers) to hang out, perhaps discuss making, and hopefully get inspired. Every now and then a makerspace will throw a party and invite people to check out their space, and provide food, drink, and sometimes entertainment. Parties are fun events where you get to meet and hang out with other makers and if it's held at a makerspace you get to see that as well.
